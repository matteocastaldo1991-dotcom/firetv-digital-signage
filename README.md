# Open Digital Signage for Shops (Fire TV Ready)

**A free, self-hosted digital signage system to show videos on TV screens and manage them remotely.  
No subscriptions. Full control. Designed for real shops.**

---

## What is this project?

This project is a **simple digital signage system** designed for physical shops, showrooms, galleries, and retail spaces that want to display videos on one or more TV screens and update them remotely.

It allows you to:
- connect a TV to a Fire TV Stick (or any browser-based device),
- open a player page in kiosk mode,
- manage video playlists from a web dashboard,
- update what is shown on the screen **without being on site**.

Once installed, the system works automatically and continuously.

---

## What can you do with it?

- Show promotional videos in shop windows  
- Display announcements, events, special openings  
- Change videos remotely from any computer  
- Manage different screens for different locations  
- Keep screens always on, without menus or distractions  

The screen updates itself when you modify the playlist — no manual refresh, no local interaction.

## Why this system exists

Most digital signage solutions:
- require monthly subscriptions  
- rely on proprietary cloud platforms  
- lock you into specific hardware or services  

This project was built to be different.

### Key principles
- **Free and open-source**
- **Self-hosted**
- **No subscriptions**
- **No vendor lock-in**
- **Works with inexpensive hardware**

You own the system and your content.

## Important to know (please read)

This is **not a hosted SaaS service**.

The system must be installed on **your own hosting** (or on a server provided by your technician or agency).  
This is what makes it free and independent from third-party platforms.

Once the installation is completed, **daily usage is very simple**:
- upload videos
- manage playlists
- update screens remotely

You do **not** need technical skills to use it every day,  
but the **initial setup requires basic hosting access** or technical support.

> If you don’t want to handle the setup yourself, a developer or agency can install it for you in less than one hour.

## How it works (simple explanation)

1. A TV is connected to a Fire TV Stick (or similar device)  
2. The Fire TV opens the signage player in kiosk mode  
3. Videos are played automatically in a loop  
4. You manage videos and playlists from the web dashboard  
5. Any change appears on the TV within seconds  

After setup, the system runs on its own.

## Designed for real retail environments

The system is built with real shops in mind:

- Continuous playback  
- Automatic recovery if the connection drops
